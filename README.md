### 12 Months, 12 Projects - Project #1

Gitara is a smart analysis tool for GitHub repositories. It helps you understand the structure and tech stack of any project instantly.

Instead of browsing files one by one, Gitara scans the repository and presents everything in a clean, professional dashboard. You can see the file structure, dependencies, and key statistics at a glance.

**What it does:**
- **Visual Analysis:** See the breakdown of files and folders clearly.
- **Dependency Overview:** Instantly identify frameworks and libraries used.
- **Simple & Fast:** Just paste a GitHub link and get results in seconds.

**About the Challenge:**
This is the first project of my "12 Months, 12 Projects" challenge. The goal is to build, polish, and launch a new application every month for a year to master different technologies and product development skills.
